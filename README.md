# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

Dataset is from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013


You can try the model by executing the script RealTime-Emotion-Recognition.py and be sure that the files fer.h5, fer.json and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml are in the same directory as the script.

The accuracy of the model is 57%, i will work on it more to improve it.
